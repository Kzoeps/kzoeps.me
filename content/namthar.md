- Tashi Dorji Case Visualization

- Metal structure & maatsi tangni, attaching those white flowers to the cup

- Conversations with the king and being his chill trusted friend (thinking its the humanization from wikileaks)

- T.W reddit account commenting & me freaking out

- Selsi green eyes, plump lips: smiling a lot

- Aezay toh, defying older people at the food place wangdue (The restaurant between the borders of Trongsa and wangdue with the yum food). Dude told girl next to me to make tea instead of himself when she and I ordered tea.

- JTN, the girl who got raped was the daughter of a neighbour of his. And how she had been struggling and her mom was struggling and that inturn made JTN's mom struggle cause they were friends. And how JTN was suffering because of it

- Constructing a new house, I'm going to get something from the top of the house. Suddenly I leave my phone on the top floor and as I go to get it. Memay is like dont go there are evil spirits there. As I say I left my phone and laugh off the part about evil spirits he then says okay ill come with you. As we head up top an evil spirit, one that is kinda like the one from myst might and heaven takes away memay. I am told to cut the ropes by a higher being but cutting the ropes is equivalent to me losing my hands as well. However as much as I struggle i do it. and suddenly exactly the time the spirit comes by the building falls right on top of the spirit and kills it. Memay turns out to be an angel but dies at the hands of the spirit.
