- Constructing a new house, I'm going to get something from the top of the house. Suddenly I leave my phone on the top floor and as I go to get it. Memay is like dont go there are evil spirits there. As I say I left my phone and laugh off the part about evil spirits he then says okay ill come with you. As we head up top an evil spirit, one that is kinda like the one from myst might and heaven takes away memay. I am told to cut the ropes by a higher being but cutting the ropes is equivalent to me losing my hands as well. However as much as I struggle i do it. and suddenly exactly the time the spirit comes by the building falls right on top of the spirit and kills it. Memay turns out to be an angel but dies at the hands of the spirit.
