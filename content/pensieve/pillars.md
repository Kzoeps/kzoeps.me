A person(s) who we always lean on whenever something is amiss. A part of our life and a personality we always turn towards when the obstacles loom to large? Who is yours anon? What god do you turn to when everything seems unsurmountable?

For me, there is no god. Just a small handful of people who i entrust vulnerable facets of me, whenever something is amiss. My brother the biggest cornerstone in my life, to entrust all problems I think too unsurmountable. Dorji, I entrust to help me find humor in all situations I face and to sometimes just drag me down to earth and to give me that sense of the tao, the ever flowing nature of the earth and of our lives. Someone to entrust all that is close to the heart, all matters of vulnerability that is hard to share in a space of masculinity. to lean on and to find the spark and excitement to life. To think about the relationships I've made along the way and the growth that I've achieved and have seen the other person achieve. To know that I am a pillar for someone else and that relationships can extend beyond time and proximity.

Pillars. anon. Pillars
