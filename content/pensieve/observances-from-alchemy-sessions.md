After numerous night out sessions at space and alchemy, one thing i've noticed is that people (I) really want to feel the aliveness of other human beings.

These third spaces allows me to kind of be in this liminal space where i'm part of the group but yet not really. Being in the same space with people you dont neccessarily know but kinda doing the same activity.

But the space needs to feel cozy, it needs to feel full and only when there is that fullness does it exude that energy of youth, of this sense of being alive. And i feel like big rooms/large spaces are really bad for this.

Say some space can hold 20 people and theres 10, if there is a lot of negative space between the groups it feels like such a dead space. like a huge hallway with no one really there. But then you have a small terrace that can only accommodate around 7 people and you put 4 or 5 and people in there and it instantly feels like there is something happening. it gives this sense of busyness and aliveness.

And so i think that for any new spaces that open up in t-city there needs to be careful division of spaces so that it can "accomodate" various amount of groups of people and still make them feel cozy.

I feel like space-34 captures that perfectly with the white room, the smoking room and the dance floor. where the dance floor accomodates for the larger amount of groups on busy days, the white room for a smaller set of people and the smoking room for an even smaller set of people.

I think a way to close off these spaces until a certain amount of people come through for those spaces to open would be pretty cool. just not sure how?
