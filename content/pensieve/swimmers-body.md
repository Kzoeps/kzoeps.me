the swimmers body illusion: you think professional swimmers have this sexy body because they swim. but its rather the other way round. they're professional swimmers cause their bodies be made for swimming. Just built different.

But i think this example digresses from the main point of this example.

I've come across small incidences in my life where we think we are infallible to something because in our heads we've never done it. Eg: I always turn the stove off before I leave, yeah but the thing is you'll  never remember the times where you left the stove on cause if you remembered it you'd turn it off.

I always turn the lights off/close the door when I leave. Again you only remember the times where you deliberately closed the door and turned the lights off. Never the times you left it on, cause if you were intentional in that moment you would know for sure you turned it off. Or if you remembered you kept it on you'd go to turn it off.

What I think this gets to is that we are all susceptible to mistakes, even mistakes we are sure we would never be susceptible of. And I think this isn't a flaw, realizing this makes us think of the other person as a human making mistakes.

For me I see it in the frame of making me more compassionate and empathetic. It helps me reason the fact that its usually not bad intentions just the lack of intentions thats the problem. The opposite of love isn't hate its indifference, and I guess what ruins the world isn't necessarily rooted in evil but more so in the sense of lost living.
