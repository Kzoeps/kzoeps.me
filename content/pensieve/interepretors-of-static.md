One thing that stuck with me after reading the biggest bluff by maria konnikova is that we are all interpretors of the static. We can only navigate and think about the present, and the past. We never know how it will ever play out in the future. There are too many unknowns, we can think about it a lot but we wont ever be able to imagine even a shred of the countless possibilities. 

There's a buddhist story about a farmer (she talks about it but as always old questions have old answers). He loses his horses, his neighbour comes home to give his condolences, he shrugs. The horses come back with even more horses, his neighbour comes to congratulate him, he shrugs. His son breaks his leg riding the horse, his neighbour comes to give his condolences and he shrugs again. A war breaks out and his son avoids the draft because of his broken leg.

And I think thats been the case for me as well. What was a win when I got into Conn (ED) I would never imagine to be one of the darkest year of my life after. Yet I would never imagine a really shitty college experience to compound into meeting some of the people I hold dear to my heart today.

A recent one: getting a remote job, was a win but is it truly a win. Maybe its stopping me from fully going out right now and getting a job. But even getting a job in the US is it truly a win. The paths infront of us is too misty. Covered by the fogs of the unknown.

What is a dub and L is confuscated by our blindness and ignorance of the future. A dub might be an L and a L might be a dub. In the words of sabrina two Ls make a W.

This piece of story from this book that I read at a time where I was an anxious fucker, still am but not as much, has helped me to stay anchored to the present. And to make light of my losses, and to ground me when I win. For we are all interpretors of the static. We can't see beyond it.
