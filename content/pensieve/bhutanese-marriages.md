Recently been fascinated with watching bhutanese wedding videos. Started off with one or two appearing on my feed to actively searching for "bhutanese weddings" on youtube. Have watched a lot of these from a [mongolian bhutanese couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXrByPiI3sg) to [miss bhutan runner up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxjOTIUjLKY) getting married.

And watching all these videos, you notice the uptick in bhutanese wedding videos in the last 5-6 years. Social media has changed the way we celebrate a lot and it's made all of these eventful celebrations more extravagant and flashy. It is interesting how the weddings have now evolved to include at least a 2 tiered, very decorative, very instagrammable cake and a champagne. It's also interesting how much cars play a status symbol role in our society. The weddings always feature a shot of the bride and the groom getting into a land cruiser or atleast a foreign SUV.

Also man [the food](https://youtu.be/akwvBq5CF3I?si=cvShORO8qbbebdYU&t=730) at these weddings look to die for mae. I guess food is also something we equate, or atleast my family and those close to me do, to the success, maybe not even success but as a metric for how good the event is. If the food is delicious its always ++ points. And no matter how aesthetic a wedding or event might be if the food does not slap it's always a huge disappointment.

Along these lines you also see the socio economic differences. By virtue of how grand these events are and how capital intensive it must be obviously most of these families are upper middle class and higher. But even within these you can see the difference in wealth. And the counter-signalling that usually happens.

In the really loaded ones like the mongolian bhutanese wedding you rarely see any shots of the fancy cars or the shots of high profile people. Its usually very aesthetic, personal and more artsy vibes tsham chi. In the likes of the upper middle class you see that they tend to portray the shots of the cars theyâ€™re riding in, and then shots of high profile guests. This (counter)signalling is really interesting to see and something you can make out as you watch multitude of these videos.

The 1% gi 1% wedding videos I guess we will never see it uploaded on youtube. Only glimpses from ig stories. Recent high profile wedding was JD rebellions and Serchung (gyaltsuens num) gi marriage. And that was also very interesting to see how they celebrated it. And how the bar for grandiosity even among these rich rich people keeps on increasing. 3 parties for the wedding, one in bumthang (a very personal one) to 2 grand and more public ones in thimphu. Is this the trend for how these weddings will go about.
