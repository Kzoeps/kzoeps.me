![harris](/images/harris.jpeg "Harris")
Harris is an interesting place. It's been my favorite third-space on campus where I can do a lotta people watching and hopefully i dont look that weird.

But one thing thats interesting as you sit watching in the corner is that. People who hang out at harris are very much alike to themselves. All the tables are clusters of people who are alike.

it kinda sounds obvious but as you go more and more macro, it gets interesting. All the geeky, video game obsessed group find a cluser/table for themselves, the athletes find a cluster for themselves, and so do the international students. There's sometimes an asian kids cluster, black kids cluster and hispanic cluster.

Minimize the data even more and then you see that the POC kids are usually on the left half of harris. close to the grill. And the athletes/white kids usually on the right half of harris. In all of my 4 years here I have eaten only 5 times on the right side of harris.

How do these groups form and what is the meta that is at play here? Maybe we are all just walking algorithms.
