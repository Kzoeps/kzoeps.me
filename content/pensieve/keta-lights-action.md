I met bobby at city cinema. Nosam tang ra matsubay kho, that I went to watch the movie alone. Was quite a funny interaction. But im glad he told me about the movie cause it really is really nice. I think it does try to do a bit too much and theres so many things it tries to explore that it feels like it doesnt touch too deeply into any of the topics its trying to explore. Its all tied together by a loose concept of the protagonist wanting to be an actor yet I really enjoyed it. What i mean by it tries to explore too much is that it sometimes felt like there were scenes that tried to explore into the life of the side characters but its so haphazard and lacks any depth to it that it feels like more of a distraction. Also tries to portray relationship between two brothers but then the brother suddenly dies and its so sudden that you dont feel any emotional pang to it. I guess thats my gripes with it.

But the dialogs are so natural, there’s zero corniness to it and its very humorous. And i think its a form of humor that doesnt try to hard, also i think a very bhutanese sense of humour that might be hard to translate. I think it also inculcates this sense of bhutanese humor intimes of some of our biggest struggles. Of trying to joke around our way out of the struggle. It was pretty funny that theres comedic scenes always on the wrong time: eg when the brother dies, when we’re exploring a support characters struggle with self esteem and condescension. Idk i think you just have to watch the movie to actually get the dialog.

I think i also really liked how meta the movie is, how it tends to break the fourth wall quite a lot. How there are a lot of cameos and how the movie is a movie about the process behind movies. And i think he skillfully does this. I think these concepts are rather hard to pull off but it worked out in this one. I feel like also the integration of the nervousness of a keta when people come to watch the movie and the fact that the cinema he used for the shot is where the screening is done. This sense of metaness not just in the movie itself but the location as well idk it did give me a sense of his own anxiousness. Also i think knowing the context of the movie itself as well about how the producer/director of this film also sold his own bike to produce this and how that same thing happens in the movies as well. This blending of reality and fiction for me tripped me up and I enjoyed it even more because of that I think. I think before I went to watch the movie someone told me about how nobs struggled to produce this movie how he used a lot of his own savings into it. And then the movie portrays nobs struggling to pay bills, betting his shot on being a keta and idk in that space and time it just got blended in for me.

Ahh i think im unable to convey what i really liked about the movie but anyways solid 8/10.
